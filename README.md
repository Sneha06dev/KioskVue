# KioskVue

KioskVue is an AI-powered retail kiosk system that enhances the shopping experience by integrating real-time handwriting recognition and product recommendations. This project leverages Google Generative AI (Gemini API) to generate effective tokens from handwritten input, which are then searched in a CSV file to display relevant store products.

## Features

- **Color-Based Mask Detection:** Users can set the color of the mask to be detected using sliding bars. The default color is set to blue.
- **AirWrite Interface:** Drawing is performed only on the basis of the detected color, allowing precise interaction.
- **Google Gemini API Integration:** Generates effective tokens from the handwritten input.
- **CSV-Based Product Search:** Matches extracted tokens with products stored in a CSV file.
- **Real-Time Product Display:** Shows matching products dynamically as the user draws.
- **Intuitive UI:** Simple, fast, and user-friendly kiosk interface.
- **Efficient Image Processing:** Saves and processes handwritten input effectively.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Flask
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API for token generation

- **Elderly and Disabled Users:** Offers an accessible way to interact with kiosks without requiring complex touch or voice interactions.
- **Visually Impaired Users:** Users who are blind or have low vision can use the AirWrite interface with guided assistance to write and browse products without needing a traditional keyboard or screen.
